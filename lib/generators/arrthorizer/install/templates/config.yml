# This file contains the configuration for Arrthorizer. It defines privileges and links them to
# both Controller Actions and the Roles that are allowed to use them.
#
# Say we're writing a forum, and we have a Forum::TopicsController with the default REST actions.
# We might want to split these REST actions into Create, Read, Update and Delete privileges
# (Let's call them 'create_forum_topic', 'read_forum_topic', 'update_forum_topic' and
# 'delete_forum_topic'. None of these names are magically generated - *you* get to choose the
# names).
#
# Let's also assume that we have Roles for Forum::TopicStarter and Forum::Administrators.
# ForumTopicStarters may be allowed to delete any topics they started and update them in
# whatever way they deem relevant, but not change any topics they did not start themselves. This
# means the role would be a ContextRole. The administrators can do anything they bloody well
# please with any topic at all (therefore, the role would be a Group). Let's also assume
# you have a LoggedInUser role which allows anyone to see any topic or start a new one, as
# long as they're logged in.
#
# We would define these privileges as follows:
#
# read_forum_topic:
#   actions:
#     - forum/topics:
#       - show
#       - index
#   roles:
#     - LoggedInUser
#
# create_forum_topic:
#   actions:
#     - forum/topics:
#       - new
#       - create
#   roles:
#     - LoggedInUser
#
# delete_forum_topic:
#   actions:
#     - forum/topics:
#       - destroy
#   roles:
#     - Forum::TopicStarter
#
# update_forum_topic:
#   actions:
#     - forum/topics:
#       - edit
#       - update
#   roles:
#     - Forum::TopicStarter
